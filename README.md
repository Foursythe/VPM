# One Dimensional Projectile Motion.

## This repository aims at solving projectile motion problems in one dimension ONLY.

### For this to work, a few assumptions have to be made:
- The obeject is in free fall. This means that the only force acting on an object, is gravity.
- The gravitional accelaration is a constant value of -9.8m/s^2.
